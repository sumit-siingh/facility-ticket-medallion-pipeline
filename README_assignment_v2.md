# Take-Home: AI-Assisted Medallion Pipeline

**Role:** Data Engineer
**Time budget:** 4-5 hours
**Deliverable:** GitHub repo (public or private, share access if private)

---

## Scenario

You receive a messy, real-world dataset (`data/raw_tickets.csv` — ~10k rows of operational support tickets). 

Your task: design and implement a **medallion architecture** (bronze -> silver -> gold) where **AI agents** assist in making the pipeline construction smarter and more efficient.

---

## Part 1 — Medallion Pipeline (50%)

Build a working bronze -> silver -> gold pipeline:

| Layer | Expectation |
|---|---|
| **Bronze** | Raw ingestion, schema-on-read, no data loss. Include lineage metadata: source file, `ingested_at` timestamp, row hash for dedup tracking. |
| **Silver** | Cleansed, deduplicated, typed, validated. Document your cleaning rules and why you chose them. |
| **Gold** | Business-ready aggregations or models. Pick 2-3 that would be useful given the dataset and justify your choices in the README. |

You can use PostgreSQL to keep it simple or any other data storage solution. Show clear separation between layers — schemas, naming conventions, or whatever approach you prefer. Just be intentional and explain your choice.

**Pipeline requirements:**
- Idempotent and re-runnable
- Clear logging of what happened at each stage
- Handle the provided data's messiness without manual intervention

---

## Part 2 — Agentic Acceleration (50%)

Build one or more AI agents that make the bronze -> silver -> gold process faster, smarter, or more adaptive. Pick **at least two** of the following:

### a) Schema Inference & Evolution Agent

- Given a raw bronze table, the agent inspects sample rows, proposes a typed silver schema, and generates the DDL + transformation SQL
- Bonus: detects schema drift when new data arrives and proposes migrations

### b) Data Quality Agent

- Profiles the bronze layer — distributions, null rates, outliers, cardinality
- Proposes cleaning/validation rules in natural language, then generates the SQL or Python to implement them
- Should explain *why* a rule matters, not just flag anomalies

### c) Semantic Classification Agent

- Takes free-text or ambiguous columns and enriches them — categorization, entity extraction, normalization
- Output lands in silver as new structured, queryable columns
- Show how you'd handle this at scale (batching, caching, cost awareness)

### d) Gold Layer Design Agent

- Given the silver schema + a plain-English description of the business domain, proposes gold layer aggregations and models
- Generates the SQL for the materialized views or tables
- You should be able to explain when you'd trust the agent's output vs. override it

## Evaluation Criteria

| Area | What we're looking for |
|---|---|
| **Medallion design** | Clean layer separation, lineage tracking, idempotency |
| **Agent usefulness** | Does the agent actually save time vs. doing it manually? We value honesty over impressiveness. |
| **Prompt engineering** | Quality of instructions to the LLM — context provided, output format constraints, guardrails |
| **Cost and scale thinking** | How would this work on 10M rows? What would you batch, cache, or skip? |
| **Tradeoff awareness** | Where agents added real value, where they didn't, and what changes at production scale |
| **Code quality** | Clean, readable, minimal. No over-engineering. |

---

## Required in your README

1. **Architecture diagram** — a simple box diagram is fine
2. **Agent assessment** — for each agent you built: what it does, a sample input/output, and your honest take: *"this saved me X"* or *"this was more trouble than it was worth because Y"*
3. **What changes at 100x scale** — brief section on what you'd redesign if this were 1M+ rows with daily incremental loads
4. **How to run** — single command to get everything up (`docker-compose up`, then run script)

---

## Good to have

These are not required for the take-home, but we love to see thoughtful touches:

- **Data lineage** — end-to-end traceability from source through bronze, silver, and gold (who/what/when for each transformation).
- **Metadata auto-tagging at landing** — automatic classification or tagging of datasets and columns as they land in bronze (e.g., sensitivity, domain, PII hints).
- **Cross-source reconciliation and dimensional model recommendation** — checks across inputs for consistency, and suggested star/snowflake-style models or conformed dimensions aligned to the business.
- **Agent evaluation harness** — a small, repeatable test set and scoring rubric to compare agent outputs (accuracy, format compliance, latency, cost) before promoting prompt/tool changes.
- **Human-in-the-loop approval gates** — explicit checkpoints where high-risk agent suggestions (schema changes, destructive transforms, major recategorizations) require review before execution.
- **Incremental + backfill strategy** — clear handling for late-arriving records, replay windows, and deterministic reprocessing without double counting.
- **Observability and SLA thinking** — pipeline + agent metrics (row counts, null deltas, failure rates, token/cost usage) with basic alerting thresholds.

The raw dataset is at `data/raw_tickets.csv`. Do not modify this file — your bronze layer should ingest it as-is.

Use any language (Python preferred), any AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models — your call), and any orchestration framework (LangGraph, CrewAI, raw tool-use loop, or none).
